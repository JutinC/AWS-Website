                <h2>Unit 4: AWS Cloud Security</h2>
                <p>
                    1. IDENTITY AND ACCESS MANAGEMENT (IAM)
                    IAM controls who can log in and what they are allowed to do inside AWS. This is the main way AWS handles permissions and account security.
                    Core IAM Components
                    Root User
                    The main account owner created when you first open an AWS account.
                    
                    
                    Has full access to everything.
                    
                    
                    Best practice:
                    Never use root for daily work
                    
                    
                    Turn on MFA immediately
                    
                    
                    Risk:
                    If root is hacked, the entire account is compromised.
                    
                    
                    
                    IAM User
                    Represents a person or application that needs access to AWS.
                    
                    
                    Has a username and either a password (for console) or access keys (for API).
                    
                    
                    Pros:
                    Easy to create and manage
                    
                     Cons:
                    
                    
                    Long-term access keys can be stolen if stored badly
                    
                    
                    Best practice:
                    Avoid giving users permanent access keys when possible.
                    
                    
                    
                    IAM Group
                    A collection of users with the same permissions.
                    
                    
                    Example:
                    “Admins” group
                    
                    
                    “Developers” group
                    
                    
                    Benefit:
                    Easier to manage permissions for many users at once
                    
                    
                    Weakness:
                    If group policy is too powerful, all users in the group become risky.
                    
                    
                    
                    IAM Role
                    A set of permissions that something can temporarily assume.
                    
                    
                    Used by:
                    EC2 instances
                    
                    
                    Lambda functions
                    
                    
                    Applications
                    
                    
                    Cross-account access
                    
                    
                    Major advantage:
                    Uses temporary credentials (much safer than long-term keys)
                    
                    
                    Best practice for AWS services
                    
                    
                    Example:
                    An EC2 instance uses a role to read from S3 without storing any password.

                <p>
                    
                    IAM Policy
                    A JSON document that defines permissions.
                    
                    
                    Policies answer:
                    Who can do what
                    
                    
                    On which resource
                    
                    
                    Under what conditions
                    
                    
                    Example:
                    Allow user to read objects from one S3 bucket but not delete them.
                    
                    
                    Types:
                    Managed policies (created by AWS or reusable by you)
                    
                    
                    Inline policies (attached directly to one user/role/group)
                    
                    
                    Weakness:
                    Writing policies incorrectly can either block everything or allow too much access.
                    
                    
                    
                    IAM BEST PRACTICES (VERY TESTABLE)
                    Least Privilege
                    Only give the minimum permissions needed to do the job.
                    
                    
                    Why:
                    Reduces damage if an account is hacked or misused.
                    
                    
                    
                    Use Roles Instead of Access Keys
                    Roles use temporary credentials.
                    
                    
                    Access keys are permanent and risky.
                    
                    
                    Benefit:
                    Much safer
                    
                    
                    Automatically rotated
                    
                    
                    
                    Enable MFA (Multi-Factor Authentication)
                    Requires a second code from a phone or device.
                    
                    
                    Use on:
                    Root account
                    
                    
                    Admin users
                    
                    
                    Advantage:
                    Stops hackers even if they steal your password
                    
                    
                    
                    Rotate Credentials
                    Change passwords and access keys regularly.
                    
                    
                    
                    2. ENCRYPTION AND KEY MANAGEMENT
                    Encryption protects data so only authorized people can read it.
                    Types of Encryption
                    Encryption in Transit
                    Protects data while moving across the internet.
                    
                    
                    Uses HTTPS / TLS.
                    
                    
                    Example:
                    When a user uploads a file to S3 using HTTPS.
                    
                    
                    
                    Encryption at Rest
                    Protects data while stored on disk.
                    
                    
                    Used in:
                    S3
                    
                    
                    EBS
                    
                    
                    RDS
                    
                    
                    DynamoDB
                    
                    
                    Benefit:
                    If someone steals a disk or file, they cannot read the data.
                    
                    
                    
                    AWS KEY MANAGEMENT SERVICE (KMS)
                    KMS manages encryption keys.
                    What it does:
                    Creates keys
                    
                    
                    Stores keys securely
                    
                    
                    Controls who can use keys
                    
                    
                    Logs key usage
                    
                    
                    Types of keys:
                    AWS-managed keys (easy, less control)
                    
                    
                    Customer-managed keys (more control, more responsibility)
                    
                    
                    Advantages:
                    Central control of encryption
                    
                    
                    Integrated with many AWS services
                    
                    
                    Weaknesses:
                    Costs per key and per request
                    
                    
                    Misconfiguring keys can lock you out of your own data
                    
                    
                    
                    3. LOGGING, MONITORING, AND AUDITING
                    This section helps you see what is happening in your account, detect problems, and prove compliance.
                    
                    CLOUDWATCH
                    CloudWatch monitors system performance.
                    What it collects:
                    CPU usage
                    
                    
                    Memory (with setup)
                    
                    
                    Disk activity
                    
                    
                    Network traffic
                    
                    
                    Application logs
                    
                    
                    Features:
                    Metrics dashboards
                    
                    
                    Logs storage
                    
                    
                    Alarms
                    
                    
                    Example:
                    Alarm triggers if CPU > 80% and adds more servers with Auto Scaling.
                    
                    
                    Advantages:
                    Real-time visibility
                    
                    
                    Can automate responses
                    
                    
                    Weaknesses:
                    Storing many logs can become expensive
                    
                    
                    Requires setup for advanced monitoring

                    CLOUDTRAIL
                    CloudTrail records every API action taken in your account.
                    It logs:
                    Who did the action
                    
                    
                    What they did
                    
                    
                    When they did it
                    
                    
                    From where
                    
                    
                    Example:
                    Shows who deleted an EC2 instance.
                    
                    
                    Why it’s critical:
