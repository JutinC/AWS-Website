            <p>Benefits of Cloud Computing
                Cost-effective – no upfront hardware costs
                
                
                Scalable – scale up or down instantly
                
                
                Reliable – built-in redundancy
                
                
                Secure – AWS manages infrastructure security
                
                
                Flexible – wide range of services for different use cases
                
                
                Cloud Computing Deployment Models

            <p>UNIT 2: AWS Global Infrastructure
                AWS Global Structure
                Region – A geographic area (e.g., us-east-1)
                
                
                Availability Zone (AZ) – One or more data centers within a region
                
                
                Edge Location – Used for content delivery (CloudFront)
                
                
                  Best practice: Deploy across multiple AZs for high availability.
                Why AWS Uses Regions and AZs
                Low latency
                
                
                Disaster recovery
                
                
                Compliance with data laws
                
                
                High availability
                
                
                AWS Shared Responsibility Model
                AWS and the customer share security responsibilities.
                AWS is responsible for:
                
                
                Physical data centers
                
                
                Hardware
                
                
                Networking infrastructure
                
                
                Customer is responsible for:
                
                
                Data
                
                
                Applications
                
                
                OS updates
                
                
                IAM permissions
                
                
                  Mnemonic:
                 AWS secures the cloud, YOU secure what’s in the cloud.
